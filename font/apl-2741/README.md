# Introduction

APL2741 (monospaced terminal-style font), historic interest only. This was hand digitised as a PostScript Type-3 font from an original 2741 golf-ball salvaged from an IBM selectric typewriter. Looks good on paper, but poor on screen as it is lightweight and italic. The hinting is rudimentary and even with ClearType it is hard to read!
